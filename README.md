### This project was made in 48h to prove that making a web app in one weekend is possible
I also needed to do that for a scholl project

It uses Spring for the backend and raw js as front end. <br/>
It also uses SQLite so it would be quite easy to use this on a real database. <br/>
In the config there is an option to disable Html in messages, wich fixes RCEs (I think).
